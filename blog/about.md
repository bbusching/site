I am Bradley Busching, a Software Developer at Google, working on Site
Infrastructure for YouTube. Outside of computer science, you can find me
mountain biking, snowboarding, reading, and struggling through puzzle games.

I grew up in Lombard, Illinois outside of Chicago. I spent my formative years
studying and running cross country and track. I graduated Summa Cum Laude with a
Bachelor of Science from California Polytechnic State University at San Luis
Obispo. I currently reside in San Francisco.
